            Hello runaway! <br>
            Your task will be to not be caught by any seeker (icon on the map: magnifying glass) at any time during the game. You and the seekers are only going to be allowed to move inside the red zone on the map. At the beginning you will have a certain amount of time to run away before the seekers start chasing you. Also, an update of your location for the seekers will only occur every 90 seconds. The remaining playing time will be displayed on the bottom of your screen and the countdown until the next update on the top. So that a seeker can catch you the seeker has to be within a radius of ten meters from you. When you are caught there will pop up a message and the you will be redirected to the homepage of Rambo. At this point for you the game will be over. But if you both agree you can join the seeker and help catch the other runaways. If the seekers don't manage to catch all of you runaways within the playing time you will have won. The game is over if either the playing time expired or all the runaways are caught. By the end of the game to meet up again with all the other players, you may want to define a meeting point, because as soon as the game is over you all will be redirected to Rambo's homepage. </p> <p class="message-attention">Please note: If you are playing this game close to any kind of traveled road or street, watch out on traffic when crossing. In the event of an accident Rambo will not accept any liability.</p> <p> Now good luck and have fun!
