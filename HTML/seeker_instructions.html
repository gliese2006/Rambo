            Hello seeker! <br>
            Your task will be to find all the runaways (icon on the map: runner) together with the other seekers. You habe a certain amount of playing time to do that and you and the runaways are only going to be allowed to move inside the red zone on the map. At the beginning the runaways will have a certain time to run away before you can start chasing them. Also, the position of the runaways will only be updated every 90 seconds. This makes your task as a seeker a little more difficult and you may want to think of some strategies with the other seekers. The remaining playing time will be displayed on the bottom of your screen and the countdown until the next update on the top. To catch a runaway the seeker has to be within a radius of ten meters from you for at least three seconds. Then there will pop up a message that the corresponding runaway was caught. For the runaway the game then is over. If both of you agree the former runaway can join you and help you catch the other runaways. If you, seekers don't manage to catch all the runaways within the playing time the runaways will have won. The game is over if either the playing time expired or all the runaways are caught. At the end of the game to meet up again with all the other players, you may want to set a meeting point, because as soon as the game is over you all will be redirected to Rambo's homepage. <p class="message-attention">Please note: If you are playing this game close to any kind of busy road, watch out for traffic when crossing. In the event of an accident Rambo will not accept any liability.</p> Now good Luck and have Fun!
